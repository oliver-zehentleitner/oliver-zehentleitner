Hi there!

With over 25 years of experience in IT architecture, DevSecOps, and software development, I have built complex IT infrastructures, developed automated trading systems, and conducted security audits. My core skills include Python, Kubernetes, Cloud (Azure, AWS), AI, Automation, Linux, IT Security, and Network Architecture.

In addition to my professional work, I'm also an avid supporter of the open source community, and I'm proud to have released the [UNICORN Binance Suite](https://github.com/oliver-zehentleitner/unicorn-binance-suite)) as open source software. I believe that sharing knowledge and resources is key to building a stronger and more innovative industry for everyone involved.
